Not exaclty one liners, but short enough.

### filesr and friends

filesr does search and replace in file names, using Python's .replace method.

filesrx does the same, but takes regular expressions and uses re.sub

filesrxd does a dry run of filesrx to check filesrx will do the right thing.

You can also perform a dry run via setting the environment variable DRYRUN.
